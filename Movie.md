# Movie

**Inglourious Basterds** begins in 1941. Shosanna, a jewish girl in **France**, hides beneath the floor of a farmhouse while SS colonel Hans Landa
interrogates the farmer for the presence of hidden jews in the home. When they are found, Shosanna flees while the rest are gunned down.

Later, Lieutenant Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to fight in a special Army unit, the *Basterds*, to spread terror in the German army.
They are known for killing and scalping Nazis and carving a swastika into the foreheads of the survivors. It works, and fear of the *Basterds* 
spreads through the German ranks.

Shosanna changes her identity and runs a movie theater in occupied **Paris**. She is romatically pursued by Frederick Zoller, a famous German sniper
with a high body count. Zoller has starred in a propaganda film about his success in battle. Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere
at Shosanna’s theater. Ultimately, it is decided that all of the German higherups will attend the premiere at Shosanna’s theater. Shosanna hatches
a plan to burn the theater down with the German’s trapped inside.

Meanwhile, British Royal Marine plans an attack on the premiere at the theater. He teams up with the *Basterds* to go undercover and massacre the Nazis
at the theater by meeting with a German film star, Bridget von Hammersmark. After nearly escaping a run-in with some German soldiers, von Hammersmark
is shot in the leg, and the *Basterds* lose all of their German-speaking allies.

Hans Landa is in **Paris**. He investigates the shooting, and he finds von Hammersmark’s shoe and a napkin with her information. Raine comes to the primer
posing as an Italian filmmaker, along with two other *Basterds*. Landa is at the premiere and quickly figures who the *Basterds* are. He takes von
Hammersmark to a private office, interrogates her, and then murders her when he confirms she has been working with the British and Americans. Raine
and another *Basterd* are taken prisoner. However, Landa makes a deal for immunity and allows the mission at the theater to proceed.

Back at the theater, Zoller comes calling for Shosanna, but she’s not interested, and the two them shoot each other to death. Shosanna’s man locks the
Nazis in the theater and starts the fire. At the same time, the two remaining *Basterds* at the theater enter Hitler’s box at the theater and open fire
on the Nazis as the try to escape the fire. As the fire burns, a bomb the *Basterds* suck into the theater explodes, killing everyone there.

Finally, as Landa and Raine reach allied territory, Banda honors the agreement with Landa for immunity, but only after Raine carves a swastika into
Landa’s forehead, proclaiming that this one might just be his masterpiece.
